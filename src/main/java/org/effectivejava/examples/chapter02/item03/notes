Item03: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type

A singleton is simply a class that is instantiated exactly once.
Singletons typically represent either a stateless object such as a function
or a system component that is intrinsically unique.

Note : Making a class Singleton can make it difficult to test its clients because
it is impossible to substitute a mock implementation for a singleton unless it 
implements an interface that serves as its type.
